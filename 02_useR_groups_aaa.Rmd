# R User Groups

UseR groups are listed by contintent then by country. Where appropriate, useR groups are 
divided within country, e.g. in the USA, by state & in the United Kingdom, by member country.

The suggested format for listing a group is

  * Town name: [Group name & link](http://www.example.com/); [\@Twitter_handle](http://www.example.com/)

This list was originally compiled using the information from the [Revolution Analytics](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html) blog.

## Funding

The [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) provides funding for local useR groups.

[Microsoft](http://msdsug.microsoft.com/user-group/) offers sponsorship for data science user groups, including R-foused groups.
