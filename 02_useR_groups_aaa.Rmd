# R User Groups

UseR groups are listed by contintent then by country. Where appropriate, useR groups are 
divided within country, e.g. in the USA, by state & in the United Kingdom, by member country.

The suggested format for listing a group is

  * Town name: [Group name & link](http://www.example.com/); [\@Twitter_handle](http://www.example.com/)

This lists was originally compiled using the information from the [Revolution Analytics](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html) blog.
