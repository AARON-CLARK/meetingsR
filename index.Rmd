# Overview {-}

This site attempts to list R conferences and local useR groups. Please 
feel free to add any missing group or conference. In particular, most of the associated 
twitter names are missing. There are currently __`r no_of_groups`__ R user groups and events.

To propose a change, just click the pencil icon in the top left hand corner.

We also maintain a corresponding list of __[Data Science](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsDS/)__ conferences and events.


### Technical bit {-}

The html files for this document live in the `docs/` directory of the [repository](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR/). Travis
creates the html files from the `.Rmd` files and commits them to the `docs/` directory.
